## ðŸ’¬ About Me
Musician, music technology specialist, and aspiring data analyst. I'm currently interested in AI and ML related to audio and music. Open for projects and collaborations in this field.

Motivated learner and certainly skilled in technology in general. Repairing and building things up both with my hands and with my mind is something I really enjoy. Music stimulates my creativity. The people who know me usually consider me an analytical thinker and observer.

I gathered some professional experience in post-production (synchronization) as a freelancer, mainly in editing sound for animated series.

I also produce music and provide musical services as a freelance musician and sound engineer. I worked with different DAWs (ProTools, Cubase, Logic), consoles (SSL, Toft), and audio software such as Izotope (RX 7, Ozone), UA, Waves, and many more. You can check some of my works in my [Bandcamp](https://albertoranz.bandcamp.com/) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-224022558). :notes:
