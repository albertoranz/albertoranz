# Welcome to my Github

I am musician, music technology specialist, and aspiring data analyst. I'm currently interested in AI and ML related to audio and music. Open for projects and collaborations in this field.

Motivated learner and certainly skilled in technology in general. Repairing and building things up both with my hands and with my mind is something I really enjoy. Music stimulates my creativity. The people who know me usually consider me an analytical thinker and observer.

I gathered some professional experience in post-production (synchronization) as a freelancer, mainly in editing sound for animated series.

I also produce music and provide musical services as a freelance musician and sound engineer. I worked with different DAWs (ProTools, Cubase, Logic), consoles (SSL, Toft), and audio software such as Izotope (RX 7, Ozone), UA, Waves, and many more. You can check some of my productions in my Bandcamp: https://albertoranz.bandcamp.com/ :notes:

As a teacher, I trained many people in music and guitar for more than 15 years, working with groups and individuals within all ages. This experience showed me how to work with group dynamics, adapting the level of the class to the needs of the team, and maintaining the attention from each and every student.
