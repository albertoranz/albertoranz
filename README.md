## ðŸ’¬ About Me
AWS cloud developer, consultant, and musician. I'm interested in tech related to audio and music.

Currently cloud engineering at Deloitte Germany.

I gathered some professional experience in post-production (synchronization) as a freelancer, editing sound for animated series. I also produce music and provide services as a freelance musician and sound engineer. You can check my musical work in my [Bandcamp](https://albertoranz.bandcamp.com/) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-224022558). :notes:
